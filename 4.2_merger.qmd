## Simple Merger

### Definition

The creation of a new municipality whose territory results from the union of two pre-existing municipalities.

### Implication of the change

Before (year t):

- Municipalities A (with id 1[^1])  and B (with id 2) exist as separate entities, each with its own name, code, and territory.

After (year t + 1):

- Municipalities A and B were dissolved.
- Municipality C was created, covering the combined territory of Municipalities A and B.
- Municipality C either carries forward one predecessor’s name/id or receives a new name/id.

### Examples

Based on our cross-country analysis, we identified several configurations in how newly formed municipalities—created through simple mergers—are assigned names and ids. Specifically, we observed four common combinations: (a) a new name with an inherited id, (b) an inherited name with an inherited id, (c) an inherited name with a new id, and (d) a new name with a new id. Below we present illustrative examples from different EU countries for each case.

#### a. New name with an inherited id

The case occured in 2015 and it was noticeable in 2016.

The new municipality (Commune in France) *Val de Lambronne* (id 11080) was created through the merger of the municipalities *Caudeval* (id 11080) and *Gueytes-et-Labastide* (id 11171). The name Val de Lambronne is new, and the id was inherited from the municipality of *Caudeval*. The case was registered in the metadata dataset under the id: fr-m-34-2015-2016.

</a>

#### b.Inherited name and id

The case took place in 2014 and it was noticeable in 2015.

The new municipality (Commune in Luxembourg) *Wiltz* (id 0807) was created through the merger of the municipalities *Wiltz* (id 0807) and *Eschweiler* (id 0803). Both the name and id were inherited from the former *Wiltz* municipality. The case was registered in the metadata dataset under the id: fr-m-34-2015-2016.

In some case, the inherited name of a new municipality formed after a merger sometimes consists of a combination of the names of the municipalities involved, separated by a hyphen. For example, the municipality (Commune in France) *Clux-Villeneuve* (id 71138) was created through the merger of the municipalities *Clux* (id 71138) and *La Villeneuve* (id 71578). The name is new—formed by combining the names of the merged entities—while the id was inherited from *Clux* (Case id: fr-m-10-2014-2015). Similarly, the municipality (Commune in Luxembourg) *Rosport-Mompach* (id 1006) was created through the merger of the municipalities Rosport (id 1007) and *Mompach* (id 1006). The name combines the names of both former municipalities, and the id was inherited from *Mompach*. Case id: lu-m-4-2017-2018

#### c.Inherited name with a new id

The case took place in 2017 and it was noticeable in 2018.

The new municipality (Kommune in Norway) *Larvik* (id 0712) was created through the merger of the municipalities *Larvik* (id 0709) and *Lardal* (id 0728). The name *Larvik* is inherited from the former *Larvik* municipality, and the id 0712 was new . The case was registered in the metadata dataset under the id: no-m-2-2017-2018

The new municipality (Kommune in Norway) *Indre Fosen* (id 5054) was created through the merger of the municipalities *Leksvik* (id 1718) and *Rissa* (id 1624). Both the name and the id are new (source).Case id: no-m-6-2017-2018
