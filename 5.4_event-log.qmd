This section documents the dataset responsible for recording changes — or the absence of changes — in municipal boundaries. When a change occurs, it indicates when and how it happened, and also stores additional attributes relevant to each change event. It complements the annual geometry layers described earlier.

## Dataset snapshot


| Item        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| File name   | `<country_iso>`_change_log.csv [^file] |
| Delivery    | Cumulative series (2014 – present) — one file per country that grows with each new change event |
| CRS         | n/a (attribute table) — joins to geometry via the internal ID |
| Primary key | `(munqog_code, year)` — composite key; guarantees one record per municipality-year |

[^file]: `<country_iso>` is the two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (e.g., *fr*, *de*). Example: `fr_change_log.csv`.

## Variable dictionary

Below, each field is given a short heading followed by its definition. Where a
field participates in the primary key, that fact is noted explicitly.

### `year`
**Type**: 4-digit INTEGER  
**Description**: Calendar year in which the boundary event took legal effect.
When no change occurs, identifies the annual snapshot this record belongs to.  
**Example**: `2015`  
**Constraints**: Ranges 2014 – present. **Part of the composite primary key**.



### `reference_year`
**Type**: 4-digit INTEGER  
**Description**: Companion year in the fixed two-year cycle that fully
describes a change (see Code List A1).  
**Example**: `2016`  
**Constraints**: Null when there is no change.

#### Code List `reference_year`
Two complementary rows per change:

| Row role         | Rule                                | Example values                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Event year**   | `reference_year = year + 1`         | `year = 2014` → `reference_year = 2015`|
| **Geometry year**| `reference_year = year − 1`         | `year = 2015` → `reference_year = 2014`|


### `cname`
**Type**: TEXT  
**Description**: Country name under the criteria used in the Quality of Government Institute data provision  
**Example**: `France`  
**Constraints**: See this [QoG codebook for details](https://www.qogdata.pol.gu.se/data/codebook_std_jan25.pdf)


### `original_code`
**Type**: TEXT  
**Description**: Official national municipality code as issued by the country
source.  
**Example**: `01001`  
**Constraints**: Digits only; often begins with a leading zero, so treat as
text. **Part of the composite primary key** in geometry tables.



### `munqog_code`
**Type**: TEXT  
**Description**: Project’s internal municipality identifier—stable across
years, enabling consistent tracking.  
**Example**: `fr-11080-1`  
**Constraints**: Unique per geography. **Part of the composite primary key**. For France overseas municipalities, the code goes like this: `fr-o-97353`. Note the  `o` between `fr` and `97353`.  



### `mun_name`
**Type**: TEXT  
**Description**: Municipality name exactly as provided in the source file.  
**Example**: `Val De Lambronne`  
**Constraints**: UTF-8; may include accents or special characters.



### `original_code_years_cover`
**Type**: INTEGER  
**Description**: Total years the original national code was valid.  
**Example**: `11`



### `munqog_code_years_cover`
**Type**: INTEGER  
**Description**: Total years the internal ID is valid.  
**Example**: `9`


### `recorded_change`
**Type**: BOOLEAN  
**Description**: `TRUE` if any boundary event affected the municipality in
`year`.  
**Example**: `TRUE`  
**Code list**: See A2.

#### Code List `recorded_change`

| Code  | Definition                                                      |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| TRUE  | A boundary event affected the municipality in this year.        |
| FALSE | Municipality was unaffected in this year.                       |


### `change_nature`
**Type**: TEXT  
**Description**: High-level category of change (e.g. *merger*).  
**Constraints**: Nullable when `recorded_change` is `FALSE`. See joint Code List for `change_nature`
 and `sub_change_nature`


### `sub_change_nature`
**Type**: TEXT  
**Description**: Fine-grained subtype of change (e.g. *simple*).  
**Constraints**: Nullable when `recorded_change` is `FALSE`. See joint Code List for `change_nature`
 and `sub_change_nature`

#### Code List `change_nature` & `sub_change_nature`

This code list mimics exactly the [Classification of Municipal Changes Tables](4.1_table_results.html). You can refer it to get more details. In short, this represents how those concepts landed in the dataset
