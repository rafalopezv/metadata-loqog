## Non-geographical changes

All four categories presented above represent situations where municipal boundaries are changing. However, sometimes geographical changes occur simultaneously with changes in the municipalities' legal identifiers (such as code, name, or both). Typical examples include mergers or splits, where boundary changes are accompanied by the municipality’s name or code changes. Sometimes the geographical boundaries of a municipality change, while its legal identifiers remain the same. Typical examples include all territorial transfer situations. And sometimes, municipalities' boundaries may remain unchanged while its legal identifiers are modified. We have classified these situations into the following category:

## Notes

[^1]:  We consider each change category as a relationship between two points in time — the situation before and after the change — and classify transformations based on whether municipalities were dissolved (i.e., ceased to exist as independent administrative units) or created (i.e., new administrative units were formed as a result of the change).

[^2]:The distinguishing factor from a simple merger is explicitly quantitative (more than two pre-existing municipalities involved), reflecting increased administrative, political, social, and economic complexity due to negotiations among multiple governing authorities.

[^3]:The dissolved municipality ceases to exist in legal and administrative terms. Unlike dissolution, all resulting municipalities are new creations, regardless of whether they retain parts of the name, code, or territory. Unlike separation (secession), no part of the original unit is recognized as its legal continuation.

[^4]: The key feature is that no resulting municipality is pre-existing (all are established as part of the merger process, and some are composed of parts of previously dissolved municipalities).

[^5]: This conceptual framework is designed for a study specifically tracking territorial changes in municipalities across Europe within a defined 10-year period (2014–2024). Events falling partially or fully outside this period, although potentially meeting conceptual definitions, are explicitly noted but classified separately due to the temporal constraints of the current project.

[^6]: The key criterion is the identification of legal or administrative acts of creation. Separation (secession) occurs when the relevant legislation explicitly establishes one or more new municipalities while affirming the continuity of the remaining original municipality. Continuity can be inferred when the remaining entity is not replaced, regardless of whether it retains the same name or administrative code. In cases where legal records are unclear or unavailable, territorial majority may be used as a secondary criterion: if the remaining municipality retains more than 50% of the original area, it may be treated as the continuation of the original unit. This approach ensures consistency across jurisdictions, even where naming conventions or coding systems vary.

[^7]: Unlike split, no new municipalities are created.
