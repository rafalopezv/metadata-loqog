The first dataset contains geospatial files in which every municipal polygon is tagged with an internal identifier, making municipalitys’ geographies trackable. The second dataset records the nature and characteristics of changes or stability, detailing how municipalities have evolved. The third contains the legal documentation supporting those changes, and the fourth enables NUTS (1–3) aggregation. Finally, the thematic data form a separate block, making the system fully relational and adaptable to varied user objectives.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Initially, the LoQoG project intended to use the established structure of Local Administrative Units (LAUs) across Europe (see Eurostat). In most countries, LAUs—particularly at the more disaggregated level—correspond to municipalities. While European countries do collect statistics at this level, there is no centralized service that harmonizes such data. Nevertheless, Eurostat maintains the LAU structure, which provides clearly defined and actively used borders and divisions. Across Europe, there are approximately 99,000 LAUs. For example, Sweden is assigned 290 units (its municipalities), whereas other countries have significantly more—for instance, Germany has around 11,000 municipalities.\nHowever, further analysis revealed that, for some countries, LAU units do not correspond well to the objectives of the project. Instead, municipalities were identified as a more appropriate unit of analysis for the LoQoG project. For instance, in Portugal, from 2017, LAU no longer distinguishes between two levels (LAU 1 and LAU 2)1, but includes both municipalities (municípios) and smaller administrative units called freguesias. However, freguesias do not possess the same level of authority and independence as municipalities. Compared to other EU countries—where municipalities typically serve as the primary units of local government—freguesias are better understood as subdivisions of municipalities rather than as autonomous entities. Therefore, in the case of Portugal, municipalities are a more appropriate unit of analysis than LAUs.2\nDiscrepancies between LAU units and municipalities were also identified in other countries, such as Ireland, Greece, and Cyprus. In addition, in countries with more complex administrative structures, there are significant variations in the level of detail and the way administrative units are represented within the LAU framework. Therefore, we decided that the primary units of analysis in this project would be municipalities, rather than LAUs. In most countries, municipalities correspond directly to the LAU level, but in several cases, they do not. The selected units were also expected to provide full territorial coverage of each country. In some countries, we relied on national experts to determine the most appropriate units to include.",

Specifically, we observed four common combinations: (a) a new name with an inherited id, (b) an inherited name with an inherited id, (c) an inherited name with a new id, and (d) a new name with a new id. Below we present illustrative examples from different EU countries for each case.\n\n\nThe case occured in 2015 and it was noticeable in 2016.\nThe new municipality (Commune in France) Val de Lambronne (id 11080) was created through the merger of the municipalities Caudeval (id 11080) and Gueytes-et-Labastide (id 11171). The name Val de Lambronne is new, and the id was inherited from the municipality of Caudeval.

Both the name and id were inherited from the former Wiltz municipality. The case was registered in the metadata dataset under the id: fr-m-34-2015-2016.\nIn some case, the inherited name of a new municipality formed after a merger sometimes consists of a combination of the names of the municipalities involved, separated by a hyphen. For example, the municipality (Commune in France) Clux-Villeneuve (id 71138) was created through the merger of the municipalities Clux (id 71138) and La Villeneuve (id 71578). The name is new—formed by combining the names of the merged entities—while the id was inherited from Clux (Case id: fr-m-10-2014-2015). Similarly, the municipality (Commune in Luxembourg) Rosport-Mompach (id 1006) was created through the merger of the municipalities Rosport (id 1007) and Mompach (id 1006).

    "text": "The literature identifies various types of municipal changes, which can be broadly categorized into geographical and non-geographical changes. Geographical changes involve modifications to municipal boundaries, non-geographical changes, by contrast, affect the legal identifiers of municipalities—such as names or administrative codes—without altering their physical boundaries. In some cases, such non-geographical changes occur independently, with no accompanying changes to the municipality’s territory. For instance, municipalities may undergo name changes to reflect historical, cultural, or political factors, or experience adjustments to their official registry codes. These constitute purely non-geographical changes, as the territorial extent remains constant while the legal attributes are updated (see Figure 1). Conversely, geographical boundaries may change while the municipality’s legal identifiers remain unchanged. A typical example of such purely geographical changes is a territorial transfer. In some cases, however, geographical and non-geographical changes occur simultaneously—for example, during municipal mergers or splits, where a change in boundary (geo) coincides with a change in name or administrative code (non-geo).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Intersection of geo and non-geo changes of the municipalities\n\n\n\n\n\nTo date, only a limited number of studies explicitly distinguish between geographical (i.e., boundary‐related) changes and non‐geographical modifications of municipalities in their analyses (Goerlich & Ruiz, 2018; Kociuba & Kociuba, 2023). In most cases, researchers focus on a single type of municipal change—typically within the context of a specific territorial reform—without differentiating between changes to boundaries and changes to legal identifiers. Moreover, due to the diversity of procedures and forms that municipal changes can take, most existing studies are confined to a single country, and in some cases, even to a single administrative unit within that country (see (Blesse & Baskaran, 2016; Heinisch et al., 2018; Strebel, 2018)).\nThus, some papers focus exclusively on mergers processes: for example, in the Netherlands (Allers & Geertsema, 2016), Denmark (Blom-Hansen et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2014), Finland (Harjunen et al., 2021; Moisio & Uusitalo, 2013), Norway (Solvang et al., 2025), etc. Others research papers are devoted only to the splits processes: for example, in Sweden (Brink, 2004; Erlingsson et al., 2024), Slovenia (Bačlija Brajnik & Lavtar, 2021), Czech Republic (Lysek, 2021), Bulgaria, Croatia and Poland (Swianiewicz et al., 2024). Some studies examine municipal mergers and splits across multiple countries (Klausen, 2024; Swianiewicz, 2019), but such cross‐national research remains uncommon. Similarly, only a few studies consider both mergers and splits within a single country, for example in Hungary (Dobos, 2021). However, comprehensive analyses covering both types of changes simultaneously remain relatively uncommon.\nAt the same time, the majority of the papers mentioned above do not focus on analyzing the changes within municipalities themselves, but rather on the causes for these changes or their consequences or effects (see Figure 2 ). As for the causes of such changes, researchers have investigated factors such as financial incentives (Strebel, 2018), the degree of voluntariness—whether changes were initiated by municipalities themselves or imposed top‐down by higher levels of government (see (Blom-Hansen et al., 2016; Swianiewicz et al., 2022)), internal dissatisfaction within municipalities (Bačlija Brajnik & Lavtar, 2021), etc. With respect to consequences, studies have explored the impact of changes on local government spending, taxation, and service provision (Allers & Geertsema, 2016; Blom-Hansen et al., 2016; Erlingsson et al., 2024; Hansen et al., 2014), performance of local governments (Swianiewicz et al., 2024), political representation (Harjunen et al., 2021), voter turnout in local elections (Heinisch et al., 2018), trust in local politicians (Solvang et al., 2025), etc. A few studies attempt to address both the factors beyond the change and their potential consequences (e.g., (Swianiewicz, 2019)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: How we can understand the process of change: from causes to consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of all identifiable types of municipal‐level changes across EU countries during the period 2014–2024. Our approach relies on the systematic comparison of municipal shapefiles from official country sources, offering a novel geo‐based method for detecting and classifying these changes. While we do not seek to explore the underlying causes or motivations for each type of change, nor their broader consequences, our analysis enables a comparative assessment of the scale and distribution of these changes—both within individual countries and across the EU as a whole.\nOne of the main challenges we encountered was the absence of a unified and widely accepted typology of municipal changes in the academic literature. While some attempts have been made to address this gap—most notably in the contexts of Poland, Spain and the Czech Republic (Goerlich & Ruiz, 2018; Kociuba & Kociuba, 2023; Pászto et al., 2020)—they remain limited in scope. Thus, among the three studies listed above, the study by Goerlich and Ruiz (2018) is particularly relevant to our project, as it proposes a typology of boundary changes in Spanish municipalities between two points in time and distinguishes between territorial and non‐territorial changes. However, this approach has certain limitations. First, it is based on a single‐country case study, which limits its ability to capture the full range of municipal changes that may occur across different EU countries. Second, the temporal scope of the analysis (1842–2001) restricts its relevance for understanding more recent developments and complicates systematic cross‐national comparisons.\nOur project addresses these limitations by developing a harmonized typology of municipal changes that can be applied across EU member states and over a consistent time frame. This typology may serve as a foundation for more systematic, comparative studies of municipal restructuring across the EU. To date, no comprehensive source has been identified that captures the full range of municipal changes (geographical and non‐geographical) that have occurred in EU countries over the past decade. Moreover, there is a lack of harmonized data that would allow for a detailed examination of how such changes are distributed. This gap in the literature limits the capacity for systematic and comparative assessments of municipal transformations at the EU level.\nThis project seeks to address this gap through two main objectives. First, it introduces a new classification that systematically categorizes municipal changes in the EU since 2014. This classification encompasses both territorial changes and non‐territorial changes, including name changes and updates to administrative codes. Second, the project applies this classification to all EU countries to illustrate the distribution and frequency of these changes across them.",

For instance, by decree of the prefect of Jura dated 11 March 2016, the new municipality Vincent-Froideville was created through the merger of Vincent and Froideville, with the merger officially coming into force on 1 April 2016 rather than on 1 January 2017 (Legifrance 2016).\nHowever, our dataset for France only includes municipal boundary geospatial files as of 1 January of each year. As a result, our approach cannot capture territorial changes that come into effect partway through the year, such as the merger of Vincent and Froideville into Vincent-Froideville, which took effect on 1 April 2016. Approximately 4% of all municipal mergers in our French dataset fall into this category, where changes are implemented mid-year rather than at the start of the following calendar year. Such timing mismatches may lead to inaccuracies in identifying the correct administrative units during the year in which the change occurs. Taken together, all the cases presented underscore the temporal sensitivity inherent in administrative boundary data.\nThe second limitation of our approach lies in the varying resolution of the municipal boundaries represented in the geospatial files. These discrepancies in spatial precision may lead to the erroneous identification of a change—resulting in a false positive—when, in reality, no administrative modification has occurred, and the discrepancy reflects only a technical or measurement inconsistency.\nFor example, in France, out of more than a thousand cases of potential territory transfers between municipalities, we were able to legally confirm only 14 actual cases of territory transfers from one municipality to another (an example of such a transfer can be found here). The remaining cases represent merely technical discrepancies in the geospatial files across different years.\nWe recognize the limitations outlined above and have taken care to mitigate their impact. Despite these challenges, our approach provides a valuable and practical method for analyzing municipal boundary changes across countries and over comparable time periods. By combining geometric data with legal verification where possible, we offer a reliable framework for studying administrative boundary dynamics.",

    "text": "The design of the dataset is founded on the principle of documenting both change and continuity in European municipal boundaries. By capturing every merger, split, transfer, and dissolution alongside corresponding legal identifier shifts, we enable researchers to trace the full territorial and administrative evolution of any municipality from 2014 through 2024. This comprehensive record‐keeping supports inquiries into questions such as “How have municipal borders in France evolved over the past decade?” or “When and why did a given municipality change its name but not its territory?”\nTo achieve this, we have adopted a modular data architecture comprising three interlocking components, each published in open, non‐proprietary formats (GeoPackage, CSV, etc) to ensure full reproducibility and interoperability:\nAll municipal polygons are stored in a GeoPackage (.gpkg) layer, preserving geodetic accuracy and topological consistency. This format supports high‐precision mapping and spatial analyses with standard GIS tools, free from proprietary constraints.\nEvery year‐on‐year change is recorded in a “long” table structure. This module allows users to ask exactly when a merger or transfer took place in any municipality, and to quantify the frequency and types of changes over time. And a legal dataset accompanies with details of the legislation backing the changes.\nBecause every country follows the same three‐module schema, integrating new national case studies is as simple as appending their GeoPackage and CSV files. This design guarantees scalability: as our project grows to encompass additional European nations, the unified structure remains intact, allowing seamless, cross‐national comparisons and longitudinal analyses of municipal governance and territorial change.",

    "text": "For each change in municipal boundaries, we identified an official legal document verifying that the change had occurred. In the case of France, this was accomplished via the Légifrance portal, which allows municipal changes to be traced by searching for the municipality’s name and the relevant year. In other countries, the process was more complex. For example, in Italy, although the Gazzetta Ufficiale serves as the primary official source, its search functionality is frequently unreliable. In such instances, it proved more effective to consult the websites of individual regional administrations. For example, in the Lombardy region, relevant legislative acts can be retrieved through the advanced search function of the Lombardia portal.\nBased on the results of the previous step, we first analyzed the identified cases of mergers, splits, border changes, and non-geographical changes. As an initial stage of verification, we assessed whether the observed change was consistent with legal definitions. For example, we examined whether a case classified as a split was in fact a split or rather a dissolution process, whereby a municipality is dissolved and its entire territory is redistributed among existing municipalities, without the creation of any new ones, as would occur in a typical split. Similarly, some border changes could in fact be territorial transfers or territorial exchanges or involve more complex scenarios in which a dissolution and a merger occur simultaneously. In such instances, we categorized the case as composite restructuring (see Appendix for the full typology of all identified cases).\nOnce the type of change was established and an official document confirming a change was identified, we proceeded with a three-step legal verification process. First, we assessed whether the number of units involved in the territorial change, as indicated in the geospatial files, corresponded to that specified in the official legislative sources. Second, we verified whether the names of municipalities in the geospatial files matched those used in the legal documents. Third, we identified and recorded the official date marking the change. All retrieved official documents were saved in PDF format, labeled with corresponding municipality identifiers, and archived to enable subsequent searches by identifier.\nIn cases where inconsistencies were identified, we submitted clarification requests in the appropriate national language to the relevant authorities at the country level. For example, in France, such queries were directed to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) and the administrators of the data.gouv.fr portal, which is responsible for the dissemination of official public data.",

    "text": "Our comprehensive analysis of all municipal boundary changes in the EU between 2014 and 2024 has enabled us to identify eight principal categories of geographical change and 17 corresponding subcategories, along with a separate category capturing purely non-geographical changes. Each change category is conceptualized as a relational transformation between two temporal states: the configuration before the change and that which follows it. Transformations are classified according to whether municipalities were dissolved (i.e., ceased to exist as independent administrative units) or created (i.e., new administrative units emerged as a result of the change).\nMore specifically, each case of transformation falls into one of four logical combinations: (1) municipalities are both created and dissolved; (2) municipalities are created but none are dissolved; (3) municipalities are dissolved but none are created; (4) municipalities are neither created nor dissolved. This logical structure serves as the foundation for our typology and allows for a systematic comparison across diverse national contexts.\nIt is also important to clarify that given the absence of standardized terminology and consistent definitions in the existing literature—where terms describing municipal change are frequently used interchangeably—the typology proposed below represents our conceptualization of each change nature category, based largely on the legal definitions found in national legislation relevant to each case.",

    "text": "Non-geographical changes\nAll four categories presented above represent situations where municipal boundaries are changing. However, sometimes geographical changes occur simultaneously with changes in the municipalities’ legal identifiers (such as code, name, or both). Typical examples include mergers or splits, where boundary changes are accompanied by the municipality’s name or code changes. Sometimes the geographical boundaries of a municipality change, while its legal identifiers remain the same. Typical examples include all territorial transfer situations. And sometimes, municipalities’ boundaries may remain unchanged while its legal identifiers are modified. We have classified these situations into the following category:\n\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\nSub-Change\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-geo\n\n\nChange name\n\n\nThe change of a municipality’s name.\n\n\n\n\nChange id\n\n\nThe change of a municipality’s id.\n\n\n\n\nChange name + id\n\n\nThe simultaneous change of both a municipality’s name and id.\n\n\n\n\n\n  The proposed classification, together with a geospatial comparison of municipal boundaries, makes it possible to trace the history of each municipality in the EU from 2014 onward. In other words, following a panel data logic, this approach enables the longitudinal observation of each municipality, capturing not only annual cross-sectional snapshots but also the evolution of changes over time. For instance, we found that even a single type of change from the classification table can occur multiple times to the same municipality within a ten-year period. For example, in France, the municipality (commune) Les Trois Lacs changed its ID from 27676 to 27058 in 2021, and then reverted from 27058 back to 27676 in 2023 (these changes were due to the relocation of the administrative center of the municipality (le chef-lieu de la commune)). Similarly, the same municipality may undergo different types of changes in consecutive years—for instance, transferring part of its territory in one year and participating in a merger the following year.",

Unlike dissolution, all resulting municipalities are new creations, regardless of whether they retain parts of the name, code, or territory. Unlike separation (secession), no part of the original unit is recognized as its legal continuation.↩︎\nThe key feature is that no resulting municipality is pre-existing (all are established as part of the merger process, and some are composed of parts of previously dissolved municipalities).↩︎\nThis conceptual framework is designed for a study specifically tracking territorial changes in municipalities across Europe within a defined 10-year period (2014–2024). Events falling partially or fully outside this period, although potentially meeting conceptual definitions, are explicitly noted but classified separately due to the temporal constraints of the current project.↩︎\nThe key criterion is the identification of legal or administrative acts of creation. Separation (secession) occurs when the relevant legislation explicitly establishes one or more new municipalities while affirming the continuity of the remaining original municipality. Continuity can be inferred when the remaining entity is not replaced, regardless of whether it retains the same name or administrative code. In cases where legal records are unclear or unavailable, territorial majority may be used as a secondary criterion: if the remaining municipality retains more than 50% of the original area, it may be treated as the continuation of the original unit. This approach ensures consistency across jurisdictions, even where naming conventions or coding systems vary.↩︎\nUnlike split, no new municipalities are created.↩︎",

Standardized attribute fields were introduced, including:\nTo ensure geometric validity, all spatial geometries were validated. Where invalid geometries were detected, a small buffer of 0.01 units was applied to correct topological errors.\nOur spatial analysis—understood as the examination of spatial patterns, relationships, and processes across geographic space—focused on three principal types of municipal changes: mergers, splits, and border changes (Goodchild & Haining, 2004; Rey & Franklin, 2022).\nThese changes were examined through year-pair comparisons over the 10-year period, enabling a longitudinal understanding of spatial evolution.",

To confirm mergers, a spatial intersection analysis was conducted.\nEach potentially merged municipality was intersected with the new entities in t + 1, and the area of the intersection was calculated relative to the original municipality’s area in year t using the formula:\n\\[\nIP = \\left( \\frac{I}{A_t} \\right) \\times 100, \\quad VI = IP &gt; 49\n\\]\nWhere: - IP is the percentage of intersection - I is the area of intersection - A_t is the original area in year t - VI denotes a valid intersection if IP &gt; 49\nA threshold of 49% was applied to confirm that a substantial portion of the original municipality had merged.
